Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a.
In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

=begin Given an array of equal-length strings, you'd like to know if it's possible to rearrange the order of the elements in such a way that each consecutive pair of strings differ by exactly one character. Return true if it's possible, and false if not.

Note: You're only rearranging the order of the strings, not the order of the letters within the strings!

Example

For inputArray = ["aba", "bbb", "bab"], the output should be
stringsRearrangement(inputArray) = false.

There are 6 possible arrangements for these strings:

["aba", "bbb", "bab"]
["aba", "bab", "bbb"]
["bbb", "aba", "bab"]
["bbb", "bab", "aba"]
["bab", "bbb", "aba"]
["bab", "aba", "bbb"]
None of these satisfy the condition of consecutive strings differing by 1 character, so the answer is false.

For inputArray = ["ab", "bb", "aa"], the output should be
stringsRearrangement(inputArray) = true.

It's possible to arrange these strings in a way that each consecutive pair of strings differ by 1 character (eg: "aa", "ab", "bb" or "bb", "ab", "aa"), so return true.

  arr = inputArray.map(&:chars) 
  arr = arr.permutation.to_a 
  
  arr.each do |a| 
      return true if a.each_cons(2).all? { |x| diffrence(x[0], x[1]) == 1 }
  end
  false 
end 

def diffrence(s1, s2) 
  count = 0
  
  s1.each_with_index do |c, i| 
      count += 1 if c != s2[i] 
  end 
  count
